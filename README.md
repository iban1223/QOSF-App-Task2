# QOSF-App-Task2
This is my attempt at Task2 of cohort 7's task 2 on the QOSF application    
I have implemented code using QISKIT to detect if four integers can define a rectangle. The function is isRect() and takes four integers as input. I originally planned on implementing Grover's algorithm but due to time constraints was unable to. Note, the function does still output if the four integers can define a rectangle.
